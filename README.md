# Task 1
# ATM Interface in Python

## Overview
This is a simple Python project that simulates an ATM interface. Users can perform basic ATM functions such as:
- PIN Authentication
- Checking Account Balance
- Depositing Money
- Withdrawing Money
- Exiting the System

The project is console-based and uses a class-based design for modularity and simplicity.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure PIN verification with three attempts.
- **Check Balance**: Displays the current account balance.
- **Deposit Money**: Allows users to add money to their account.
- **Withdraw Money**: Allows users to withdraw money if sufficient funds are available.
- **Exit**: Ends the session gracefully.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ATM-Interface.git
